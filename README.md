Win32-Raspbian-Wifi-Injector
============================

Connect a wifi dongle and power supply to your Raspberry Pi and do a wireless setup. No need for a monitor and keyboard. No need for buying Model B's because you don't have a USB hub. This is a continuation of the Raspbian-Wifi-Injector program started by pjadl (https://github.com/pjadl/Raspbian-Wifi-Injector).

Changes:
========

The lastest release has a GUI front-end to it.

Back Story:
===========

I met pjadl at a convention I had to attend in Las Vegas. He was talking about the Raspberry Pi and how he wanted to create a program that could edit /etc/network/interfaces file while it was still in disk image format. To complicate the matter, the file system was ext4 but he wanted to edit it on a windows machine. I decided to help him with this and gave him the appropriate information.

I was glad to see he was wanting to share this program with other people. I wouldn't have offered to help if this wasn't the case. The last I heard he had completed the hardest part of the program and was offering it up to other Raspberry Pi users.

I was shocked to see on February 23, 2014, that he decided to remove the program completely because of what he felt was "Ignorance and stupidity on the part of the Raspberry Pi forum moderators".

I contacted him immediately regarding this as it wasn't part of the deal we had made. I was able to get him to realize that despite what he feels about the moderators of the Raspberry Pi forums, it would be better if he continued with this project and let other users benefit from it. The needs of the many out weight pjadl's desire to penalize a few.

To make a long story even longer, I was able to get the complete source code for his last revision of the project. He said the project could continue, but that he was done with it himself. We made a deal for the existing code and I was able to take over ownership of it.
